	<h3> About the Artist </h3>
	<img src="images/artist.jpg" width="325" height="480" alt="Image of the Artist, Sarah">
	<p>Sarah is 22 years old.  She lives in a bustling city in the state of Indiana. She began working with
	clay when she was 18 and slowly learned more as the years went on.  She decided to open an online
	shop for her work at the age of 21. At first the only items she sold in the shop were peices of jewelry
	that she made from her clay, but as time went on she began to add more items.  When the decorated lip
	balm jars were added business really picked up and allowed her to add even more great items to her
	inventory!  She still works to this day creating new items and adding new products to her shop on a 
	regular basis. She prides herself in making each item individually without ever using molds, stamps,
	or any kind of cloning tools. The love and passion she has for her work and her items is what keeps
	her items being <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>quality</strong> works of art!</p>
