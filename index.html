	<img id="artist" src="images/artist.jpg" alt="Image of the Artist, Sarah">
	
	<p>Sarah is 22 years old.  She lives in a bustling city in the state of Indiana. She began working with
	clay when she was 18 and slowly learned more as the years went on.  She decided to open an online
	shop for her work at the age of 21. At first the only items she sold in the shop were peices of jewelry
	that she made from her clay, but as time went on she began to add more items.  When the decorated lip
	balm jars were added business really picked up and allowed her to add even more great items to her
	inventory!  She still works to this day creating new items and adding new products to her shop on a 
	regular basis. She prides herself in making each item individually without ever using molds, stamps,
	or any kind of cloning tools. The love and passion she has for her work and her items is what keeps
	her items being <strong>fun</strong> and <strong>quality</strong> works of art!

	<p> Use this tutorial to learn how to create you very own cupcake charm!</p>
	

	<ol>
		<li>Choose two colors of clay, one for the bottom of the cupcake, and one for the icing on top.</li>
		<li>Take the color you chose for the bottom and roll it into a cylinder, then squish the top and bottom of the cylinder to make both ends flat.</li>
		<li><strong>Gently</strong> roll one end between your finger and your work surface to make it slightly smaller then the top so that it looks like a cupcake!</li>
		<li>Take a small thin item, like a needle, and push it long ways against the cupcake bottom all the way around to make indentions.</li>
		<li>Now take your color for your icing and using your palm roll the clay into a long strang, but not too thin! This will be your icing and it will look best if it's slightly fat!</li>
		<li>Take the strand and begin to place it on your cupcake bottom, start in any area as long as it is near the top of the cupcake.</li>
		<li>Put the strang around, around, around, placing each passing peice slightly closer to the center, but still on top of the part that is already attached to the cupcake.</li>
		<li>Eventually you icing will come to a closing, if you have extra just pinch it off and smooth the top into a point using your fingers.</li>
		<li>Insert an eyelet (Optional) and bake your cupcake in a polymer clay safe oven following the directions on your clay package.</li>
		<li>Now you have your very own polymer clay cupcake charm!</li>
